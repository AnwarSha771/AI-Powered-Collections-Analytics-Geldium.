# AI-Powered Collections Risk Analytics — Geldium Case Study

This repository documents the end-to-end development of an autonomous, responsible AI-powered collections system for a simulated financial institution, inspired by the Forage Tata Data Analytics Virtual Experience. The repository demonstrates key data and AI skills: exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, stakeholder reporting, and system design for business impact and ethical compliance.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
See `notebooks/01_eda_analysis.ipynb` and `reports/eda-report.md` for a full EDA on customer delinquency risk factors, missing data, anomaly detection, and descriptive analytics.

### 2. Predictive Modeling Framework
Refer to `notebooks/02_predictive_model_framework.md` and `reports/model-plan.md`:
- Model selection: XGBoost for accuracy, explainability, fairness
- Top 5 features: credit utilization, payment history, debt-to-income ratio, tenure, recent credit inquiries
- Justification and evaluation strategy (AUC, F1, bias checks)

### 3. Stakeholder Reporting
See `reports/business-report.md` for a two-page, executive summary translating technical findings into actionable business strategy and recommendations.

### 4. Autonomous System Design (Executive Presentation)
Check `reports/system_design_deck.pptx` and `/images` for high-level system design, guardrails for responsible AI, autonomy/oversight framework, and business/customer outcome dashboards.
